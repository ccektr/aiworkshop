# AI Workshop - OpenEdge ABL Project

This repository contains the AI Workshop OpenEdge ABL project derived from the ProjectGengar Step-16 branch.

It demonstrates:
- ABL Business Entity pattern (see `doc/business-entity-pattern.md`).
- Separation of UI (AppBuilder .w windows) from business logic classes.
- Use of datasets and temp-tables to transport data between layers.
